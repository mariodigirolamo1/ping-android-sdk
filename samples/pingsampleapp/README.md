# Ping Sample App

A comprehensive sample application demonstrating the integration of multiple Ping Identity SDK features in a single, unified application. This app serves as a reference implementation combining authentication flows, MFA capabilities, device management, and developer tools.

## Overview

The Ping Sample App is a consolidated sample that brings together functionality from multiple standalone samples (Journey, DaVinci, OIDC, and Authenticator) into one cohesive application. It demonstrates best practices for building production-ready Android applications with the Ping Identity SDK.

## Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Journey Flow**: ForgeRock Journey-based authentication with callback rendering
- **DaVinci Flow**: PingOne DaVinci authentication flows
- **OIDC Login**: OpenID Connect web authentication

### 👤 User Management
- **User Profile**: View and display user information with JSON toggle
- **Access Token**: View, refresh, and revoke access tokens with formatted JSON display
- **Device Management**: Register, view, edit, and delete trusted devices
- **Logout**: Comprehensive logout with session management (Journey, DaVinci, OIDC)

### 🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **OATH (TOTP/HOTP)**: 
  - QR code scanning for account registration
  - Manual account entry
  - Time-based and counter-based OTP generation
  - Account grouping by issuer
- **Push Notifications**:
  - Push authentication registration
  - Notification history and management
  - Biometric authentication support
  - Challenge verification
- **QR Scanner**: Integrated camera-based QR code scanning

### 🛠️ Developer Tools
- **Configuration**: Environment selection (Staging/Snapshot) with custom URL support
- **Device Information**: Comprehensive device data collection and display
- **Diagnostic Logging**: View application logs for debugging

## Architecture

### Application Structure

The app follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
PingSampleApp
├── Authentication Flows (Journey, DaVinci, OIDC)
├── User Management (Profile, Token, Device, Logout)
├── MFA Features (OATH, Push, QR Scanner)
├── Developer Tools (Config, Device Info, Logger)
└── Shared Components (Navigation, Theme, Config)
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **PingSampleApplication**
Application-level initialization and dependency management:
- Initializes SDK clients (OATH, Push)
- Creates and manages managers (OathManager, PushManager, JourneyManager)
- Provides application-scoped AuthenticatorViewModel
- Handles Firebase Cloud Messaging setup

#### 2. **Navigation System**
Centralized navigation with proper screen routing:
- Home screen with categorized feature access
- Deep linking support for authentication flows
- Back navigation handling
- Screen-specific ViewModels

#### 3. **Authenticator Integration**
Complete MFA functionality integrated from AuthenticatorApp:
- **Managers**: OathManager, PushManager, JourneyManager, AccountGroupingManager
- **UI Screens**: AccountsScreen, PushNotificationsScreen, QrScannerScreen, and more
- **Services**: PushNotificationService, LocationService
- **Notification Handlers**: BiometricPromptActivity, NotificationActionReceiver

#### 4. **Device Management**
Comprehensive device registration and management:
- Device registration with custom names
- Device list display with platform icons
- Device editing (rename)
- Device deletion with confirmation
- Automatic list refresh

#### 5. **Token Management**
Access token viewing and manipulation:
- Pretty-printed JSON display
- Token refresh functionality
- Token revocation
- Scrollable token view with dropdown menu

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

The app supports multiple environments configured via `EnvViewModel`:

1. **Staging Environment** (default)
2. **Snapshot Environment**
3. **Custom Configuration** (manual URL entry)

Configuration includes:
- Discovery endpoint URL
- Client ID
- Redirect URI
- Scopes
- Cookie name

### Firebase Setup

For Push notifications:
1. Add `google-services.json` to the app directory
2. Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging in Firebase Console
3. Enable push notifications in device settings

### PingOne Recognize integration

The Recognize integration is optional because its Keyless SDK dependencies are hosted in protected Cloudsmith repositories.

#### Required Cloudsmith tokens

Add both tokens to a local Gradle properties file using these exact property names:

| Gradle property | Repository | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `cloudsmithTokenRecognize` | `keyless/partners` | PingOne Recognize / Keyless Mobile SDK |
| `cloudsmithTokenAesWrap` | `keyless/aeswrap` | AES wrap dependencies used by the SDK |

- **Recommended:** `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` — applies locally without changing the repository
- **Alternative:** the repository's `gradle.properties` — keep this file local and never commit it

```properties
cloudsmithTokenRecognize=<your-recognize-cloudsmith-token>
cloudsmithTokenAesWrap=<your-aeswrap-cloudsmith-token>
```

Do not place either token in source code, commit them, or share them in logs. The build reads both properties from Gradle properties and uses them to configure the protected Maven repositories in `settings.gradle.kts`.

When `cloudsmithTokenRecognize` is present and non-blank, Gradle enables the `:recognize` module and the sample compiles its real Recognize callback integration. The AES wrap repository is configured separately through `cloudsmithTokenAesWrap`; provide that token whenever the dependency graph requires AES wrap artifacts.

```bash
./gradlew :samples:pingsampleapp:assembleDebug
```

#### Run without Recognize

If `cloudsmithTokenRecognize` is missing or blank, the sample remains buildable without the protected Recognize dependency. The build excludes the `:recognize` module and selects the local Recognize stub, so Recognize callbacks are safely skipped rather than preventing the rest of the sample app from running.

This means you can work on the sample without Recognize Cloudsmith access, then add the required tokens locally whenever you need to exercise the full integration. After changing either token, sync or rerun Gradle so the correct repository and dependency graph are selected.

## Implementation Highlights

### ViewModel Initialization

The app uses application-level ViewModel initialization for the AuthenticatorViewModel:

```kotlin
// In PingSampleApplication
val authenticatorViewModel = AuthenticatorViewModel(
    application = this,
    userPreferences = userPreferences,
    oathManager = oathManager,
    pushManager = pushManager,
    accountGroupingManager = accountGroupingManager,
    testAccountFactory = testAccountFactory
)
```

Access pattern in Composables:
```kotlin
var authenticatorViewModel by remember { mutableStateOf<AuthenticatorViewModel?>(null) }

LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
    authenticatorViewModel = PingSampleApplication.getAuthenticatorViewModel()
}

authenticatorViewModel?.let { viewModel ->
    // Use ViewModel
}
```

### Device Management Pattern

Device operations follow a consistent pattern:

```kotlin
// Register Device
deviceClient.register(deviceName, deviceType, pushToken)

// Edit Device
deviceClient.update(deviceId, newName, ifMatch)

// Delete Device
deviceClient.delete(deviceId)

// List Devices
deviceClient.devices()
```

### Token Display with State Flow

Token formatting uses reactive StateFlow pattern:

```kotlin
val formattedToken = state.map { tokenState ->
    tokenState.token?.let {
        json.encodeToString(Token.serializer(), it)
    } ?: "No token available"
}
```

### Logout Session Management

Supports multiple simultaneous sessions:

```kotlin
// Check active sessions
val hasActiveSessions = state.journey || state.daVinci || state.oidc

// Logout all sessions
fun logoutAll() {
    journey.user()?.logout()
    daVinci?.user()?.logout()
    web?.user()?.logout()
}
```
